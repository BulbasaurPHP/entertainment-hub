## Admin Eblast Feature

This feature is meant for admin users to quickly and efficiently email rich text emails to all registered users in the website. 
This can be used for the newsletters created in Navaneeth's feature, or can be used separately as a way of alerting all users of scheduled maintenance to the site, special events, or other urgent notifications. 

## Challenges

I could not get this to work for the longest time. I was able to use composer and phpmailer, but it did not play well with the PDO database statements. I don't know what I was doing wrong for this. 

## Future iterations

This feature will integrate more deeply with the newsletter function, as well as improve its database security with PDO.
